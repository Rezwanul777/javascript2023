// 1️⃣ Window is the main container or we can say the 
// global Object and any operations related to entire 
// browser window can be a part of window object. 

// For ex  the history or to find the url etc.

// 1️⃣ whereas the DOM is the child of Window Object

// Difference between DOM VS BOM

//  The DOM is the Document Object Model, which deals with the document, 
// the HTML elements themselves, e.g. document and all traversal you 
// would do in it, events, etc.

// The BOM is the Browser Object Model, which deals with browser components 
// aside from the document, like history, location, navigator and screen 
// (as well as some others that vary by browser). OR 
// In simple meaning all the Window operations which comes under BOM are performed 
// usign BOM 

//HTML Events
// An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

// Here are some examples of HTML events:

// An HTML web page has finished loading
// An HTML input field was changed
// An HTML button was clicked
// Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

//4 ways of writing Events in JavaScript

// 1: using inline events alert();
// 2: By Calling a funcion (We already seen and most common way of writing) 
// 3: using Inline events (HTML onclick="" property and element.onclick)
// 4: using Event Listeners (addEventListener and IE's attachEvent)

// section 2️: What is Event Object?
// Event object is the parent object of the event object.

// for Example 
// MouseEvent, focusEvent, KeyboardEvent etc 

// section ️4️: KeyboardEvent  in JavaScript
// Events that occur when user presses a key on the keyboard, 
// belongs to the KeyboardEvent Object.

// Section 5 InputEvents in JavaScript 
// The onchange event occurs when the value of an element has been changed.

// For radiobuttons and checkboxes, the onchange event occurs when the 
// checked state has been changed.
